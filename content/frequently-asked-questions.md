  - question: What is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and
      Everything?
    answer: 42 â€“ The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a
      number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary
      representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I
      sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it
      out. End of story.
